## Coming soon...

My sister and I both passed our vivas on the same day. But that's where the similarities end. Hers lasted over four hours and mine only an hour and a half. Her thesis was over 100 000 words long and mine didn't even hit the 30 000 mark. 

Dr Emily Mason is a visiting researcher at the London School of Economics, Canada Blanch Centre. She teaches modern British history at Kings College, London and modern European history at the University of East London. She has recently published a book ["Democracy, Deeds and Dilemas"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Democracy-Deeds-Dilemmas-Republic-1936-1939/dp/1845198859), and she is my sister. 

In a new podcast we're coming together to examine the cultural and scientific evolution of concepts that underlie human behaviour. We'll take a look at how some of the biggest cultural movements in the twentieth century have changed what we think we know about human behaviour.
