# About me

I am an experimental psychologist whose research centres around memory and decision-making in humans. I use a range of experimental techniques including electroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), eye-tracking and computational modelling. 


## Bio 

I completed by undergraduate degree in Experimental Psychology at the University of Bristol.
In 2016 I finished my PhD at the interdisciplinary centre for decision-making at the University of Bristol.
My PhD work focused on how rewards improve learning and memory.

I worked for a year as a Senior Research Asociate on a multidisciplinary project examining the food reward and obesity before
moving to the University of Western Australia in Perth to work with Professor Simon Farrell.
