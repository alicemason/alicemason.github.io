# About me
I completed by undergraduate degree in Experimental Psychology at the University of Bristol.
In 2016 I finished my PhD at the interdisciplinary centre for decision-making at the University of Bristol.
My PhD work focused on how rewards improve learning and memory.

I worked for a year on a multidisciplinary project examining the food reward and obesity before
moving to Perth, Australia to work with Professor Simon Farrell.
