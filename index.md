# About me
I completed by undergraduate degree in Experimental Psychology at the University of Bristol.
In 2016 I finished my PhD at the interdiscplinary centre for decision-making at the University of Bristol.
My PhD work focused on how rewards improve learning and memory.
I also had my first experience of pre-registration and direct replications.

I worked for a year on a multidiscplinary project examining the food reward and obesity before
moving to Perth, Australia to work with Professor Simon Farrell.
