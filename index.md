# About me

Broadly speaking my research focuses on how reward signals in the environment influence
cognitive processes such as learning, memory and decision-making. I use a wide range of
experimental techniques including eye-tracking, electroencephalography (EEG), functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and computational modelling to understand how value and
memory are used to guide decision-making.

## Bio 

In May 2019 I will be moving to the University of Warwick as a Leverhulme Early Career Research Fellow. 

I completed by undergraduate degree in Experimental Psychology at the University of Bristol.
In 2016 I finished my PhD at the interdisciplinary centre for decision-making at the University of Bristol.
My PhD work focused on how rewards improve learning and memory.

I worked for a year as a Senior Research Asociate on a multidisciplinary project examining the food reward and obesity before moving to the University of Western Australia in Perth to work with Professor Simon Farrell.
